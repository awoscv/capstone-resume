    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

    
    <h5>Young Money Entertainment | Personal Assistant to Lil Wayne</h5>

    <p>I served as Lil Wayne's Personal Assistant at Young Money Entertainment. In this role, i applied my interpersonal
        abilities, persistent work ethic, and my street knowledge. There was never a day that was the same.
        One second I am picking up food the next I am rushing Wayne out of the music venue with thousands of people
        storming him; running with security and swerving through traffic.
